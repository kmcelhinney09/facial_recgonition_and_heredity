# facial_recgonition_and_heredity
This is a repository to go along with the TeachEngineering lesson on probability in heredity and facial recognition 

The facial recognition portion of this lesson/ activity is used from Adrian Rosebrock from pyimagesearch.com
Specifically from this tutorial https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/25/raspberry-pi-face-recognition/

If you would like to learn more about facial recognition and the raspberry pi I can not recommend his website enough!

The purpose of this lesson is to give students a real-life demonstration of a connection between the probability of genetics and facial landmarks. It also works as an introduction to facial recognition and cybersecurity. 

I have included a copy of the raspberry pi image I used when setting up this activity. It has all the settings, programs, and additional downloads needed to do facial recognition. I have also added the software programs I used just in case you need to redownload a program.

I used this website on how to burn the disc image on to an sd card for raspberry pi. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
